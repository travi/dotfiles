  "readme": "[grunt-runner](https://atom.io/packages/grunt-runner)\n================\n\nBuild your project using Grunt from Atom.\n\n![in action!](http://i.imgur.com/bqn9QQY.png)\n\n## How to use\n * Set a path to your local `grunt-cli` in the settings\n (may not be necessary).\n * Open a project that has a `Gruntfile.js` in the root.\n * Open the task list (`ctrl-alt-g`) and choose a task to run, or input a new one.\n * The output from the grunt task will be shown in bottom toolbar. Toggle\n the log with `ctrl-alt-t`, toggle the entire toolbar with\n `ctrl-alt-shift-t`. The toolbar will appear automatically if Grunt Runner was able to find and\n parse a `Gruntfile`, otherwise you can toggle it on yourself.\n * If your task doesn't end automatically (e.g. watches files for changes) you\n can force it stop from the toolbar or by pressing `ctrl-alt-shift-g`.\n\nSome [issues still exist](#known-issues).\n\n## Installation\n\nInstall Grunt Runner package using the command line\n\n    apm install grunt-runner\n\nOr install it from the Atom Package Manager.\n\n## Known issues\n\n * The Gruntfile must be in the root of your project directory to successfully\n get the available tasks. Additionally, all `grunt` commands will be called\n in the root directory.\n\n * Tasks added to a Gruntfile will not be automatically added until the project\n is reloaded or the page gets refreshed. They will still be callable from from\n the toolbar.\n\n * Currently hard to add tasks that prefix another task. For example, if you\n have a task in the task list called `develop`, it is impossible to add or call\n a task called `dev`\n",
